om solution swapper\

dependant on [omsim](https://github.com/ianh/omsim)

at start, measures the Primary(), Secondary() and Tertiary() metrics for each solution in the SOLUTIONS folder, then copies the worst one into the GAMEFILES folder

F8 goes back to the next worst solution\
F9 swaps the current solution out for the next best solution\
F10 updates the metrics overlay\
F11 repopulates past solves overlay with all non superceded solves in selection\
F12 repopulates past solves overlay with all solves in selection\
double-clicking a solution in the list will swap in that one

for multiple metrics, i recommend making multiple copies of this script --\
after finishing one metric, close the script for it and open the script for the next one
